     <h3>My projects</h3>
     <p>I have created one project that was advertising a business called Cute Little Pets, an organization that keeps pets for people who want to go on a vacation without necessarily carrying those pets with them. <br>To develop such project, I used HTML and CSS at the same, and trust me, it looks amazing! Have a look at it in this <a href="https://ange123ux.github.io/cute-little-pets/" target="_blank" >link.</a></p>

     <h3>Why programming?</h3> 
     <p>I chose to take this path because in the future I want to develop websites and mobile applications that organizations will use to communicate with their clients. Also, I found that it will help me to think out of the box because the more I code, the higher chances I get of solving many problems that I encounter with in my daily life.</p>
