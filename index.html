     <h3>My projects</h3>
     <p>I have created one project that was advertising a business called Cute Little Pets, an organization that keeps pets for people who want to go on a vacation without necessarily carrying those pets with them. <br>To develop such project, I used HTML and CSS at the same, and trust me, it looks amazing! Have a look at it in this <a href="https://ange123ux.github.io/cute-little-pets/">link.</a></p>

     <h3>Why programming?</h3> 
     <p>I chose to take this path because<br> in the future I want to develop<br> websites and mobile applications that organizations will use <br>to communicate with their clients.<br> Also, I found that it will help me to think out of the box <br>because the more I code, the higher chances I get of <br>solving many problems that I encounter with in my daily life.<br> You want to keep in touch with me? <br>Just send me your message <a href="here">here.</a></p>
